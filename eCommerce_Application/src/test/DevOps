### What is DevOps?

DevOps is the combination of industry best practices, and set of tools that improves an organizationâ€™s ability to:

    Increase the speed of software delivery
    Increases the speed of software evolution
    Have better reliability of the software
    Have scalability using automation,
    Improved collaboration among teams.

#### In other words, these tools enable a company to showcase industry best practices in software development.

In the DevOps model, development and operations teams are merged into a single team. These DevOps teams use a few tools and best practices to accomplish their goals efficiently. Some of these best practices are:

    Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
    Microservices
    Infrastructure as Code (IaaC) - Configuration Management and Policy as a Code
    Monitoring and Logging
    Communication and Collaboration

#### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery , and it is essentially a consistent and automated way for a DevOps team to build, package, and test applications.

    Continuous Integration means newly developed code changes of a project are regularly built, tested, and merged to a shared repository like git.

    Continuous Delivery is the process of automating the release of the merged and validated code to a repository and finally release a production-ready build to the production environment.

As shown in the figure above, CI/CD Pipeline implementation, is the backbone of the modern DevOps environment. It bridges the gap between development and operations teams by automating the building, testing, and deployment of applications.
