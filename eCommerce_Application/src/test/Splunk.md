## Splunk

### What is Splunk?

Splunk is a search engine for IT data that was created to analyze machine-generated data. We encourage you to read the official documentation to get a clear insight of the Splunk and its capabilities.

#### Machine-generated data

Machine-generated data refers to the data generated by application logs, server logs, network devices, sensors, IoT, cloud services, or mobile services. The data could be structured or unstructured.

    Structured data has clearly defined data-types and a particular pattern e.g., relational data. It resides in a database, on which we can run queries.
    
    Unstructured data has no specific pattern e.g., textual log messages, reviews on the eCommerce platform.

#### Challenges without Splunk

Machine-generated data is challenging to analyze because:

    Its volume is high
    Sometimes it is unstructured, thus requires a pre-processing

#### Benefits

Splunk helps generate information from machine-generated data and provides insights quickly. It helps to scale the data input limitlessly. It also provides machine learning capabilities to build auto-alert systems. Splunk helps the user to leverage machine-generated data in gauging the system performance, investigating the failure conditions, developing the business matrix, data visualization, and many more benefits.
